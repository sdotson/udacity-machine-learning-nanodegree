# Udacity Machine Learning Nano-degree projects

Here are the projects I've completed over the course of Udacity's Machine Learning nano-degree program.

- [Finding donors](classifying-flowers) - Used supervised learning methods to determine who is a likely donor from a dataset.
- [Classifying flowers](finding-donors) - A command line application that uses a pretrained torchvision model architecture of your choice to train the model on a given dataset, save a checkpoint for that trained model, and then use that model later to predict the class of a given image.
